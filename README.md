Purple Team Capstone Project

Red Team: EnchantedVK

Blue Team: Zzensei

Operation Exabytes is a mixture of purple team methodologies on exploiting vulnerable machines and finding ways to remediate and fix vulnerabilities. We exploited three vulnerable machines within a network, retrieved important information, demonstrated pen-testing skills and mechanics, and obtained root on the machines. Afterwards, we find different ways to remediate and patch the vulnerabilities so certain attack vectors will not be able to access sensitive information.
